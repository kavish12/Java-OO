//In Java, each file may only have one public class in it, and the name of that public class has to match the name of the file.
/*
Study Drills:
1. Try moving the entire definition of the Duck class below the OldMacDonald class. Does the code still compile and work? Answer in a comment.
Answer: Yes, it works

2. Inside the main() method, instantiate another object and call its method. (It doesnâ€™t matter which of the three objects; just pick one.)
Answer: did
